u may try implementing (simulation) the Peterson's, Dijkstra's and Dekkers algorithm for CSP solution  (for a n process set up - try with two processes first and then extend to n set up). You may test drive these algorithms using the Producer Consumer problem as an application to start with and later try dining philosophers (using the above algorithms - not using sem_wait which shall be covered in tomorrows lecture...) . Focus of todays exercise is simulation of CSP solutions usign the above three algorithms for the producer consumer and dining phil set up.
