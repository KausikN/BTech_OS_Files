Pipes

1) Test drive the codes discussed in the class in relation to IPC.
2) Basic String Manipulations (copy, concatenation,comparison, case conversion) using pipes
3) Word Count command simulation for char, word, line and sentence count using pipes (you should not invoke wc command in your c code).
4) String reversal and palindrome check using pipes / shared memory.  
5)  Develop a C program that uses pipes to perform the following: take the output of ls command and apply wc command to count the number of files in a directory, character count and line count of the ls output. you are allowed to invoke wc command for this exercise, or you may chose to invoke the wc executable developed as part of 3).
6) Setup a C program that uses bidirectional pipes to perform data transfer between the parent and child process (child and parent processes performing both in the roles of sender and receiver. extend the unidirectional pipes discussed in the class to perform 2 way data sharing).
